Hi There!  I see you have opened up my Astro Weight Calculator.  This little app takes a provided weight from the user
and calculates what the weight would be on the selected planet.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing, and install the dependencies via the terminal by
typing '$ npm install'.  Next, in the terminal, type '$ static .' to start the app on the local node server and open the
localhost:8080 in the browser of your choice.
